3.1.0
-----

New variables and builtins
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* ``Arrow`` for Graphics3D (preliminary)
* ``Cylinder`` (preliminary)
* ``Factorial2`` PR #1459 Issue #682

Enhancements
++++++++++++

Large sections like the "Strings and Characters", "Integer Functions" and "Lists" sections
have been broken up into subsections. These more closely match
online WL "Guide" sections.  This is beneficial not just in the
documentation, but also for code organization. See PRs #1464, #1473.

A lot more work is needed here.

The Introduction section of the manual has been revised. Licensing and Copyright/left sections
have been reformatted for non-fixed-width displays. #1474

PolarPlot documentation was improved. #1475.

A getter/setter method for Mathics settings was added #1472.


Bugs
++++

* Add ``requirements-*.txt``to distribution files. ``pip install Mathics3[dev]`` should work now. PR #1461
* Some ``PointBox`` bugs were fixed
* Some ``Arrow3DBox`` and ``Point3DBox`` bugs were fixed PR #1463
* Fix bug in ``mathics`` CLI when  ``-script`` and ``-e`` were combined PR #1455

3.0.0
-----

Overall there is a major refactoring underway of how formatting works
and its interaction with graphics.  More work will come in later releases.

Some of the improvements are visible not here but in the front-ends
mathicsscript and mathics-django. In mathicsscript, we can now show
SVG images (via matplotlib).  In Mathics Django, images and threejs
graphs are no longer embedded in MathML.

A lot of the improvements in this release were done or made possible with the help of
Tiago Cavalcante Trindade.

Enhancements
++++++++++++

It is now possible to get back SVG, and graphics that are not embedded in MathML.

The code is now Pyston 2.2 compatible. However ``scipy`` ``lxml`` are
not currently available on Pyston so there is a slight loss of
functionality. The code runs about 30% faster under Pyston 2.2. Note
that the code also works under PyPy 3.7.

Bugs
++++

* Tick marks and the placement of numbers on charts have been corrected. PR #1437
* Asymptote now respects the ``PointSize`` setting.
* In graphs rendered in SVG, the ``PointSize`` has been made more closely match Mathematica.
* Polygons rendered in Asymptote now respects the even/odd rule for filling areas.

Density Plots rendered in SVG broke with this release. They will be reinstated in the future.

Documentation
+++++++++++++

Go over settings file to ensure usage names are full sentences.

We have started to put more builtins in the sections or subsections
following the organization in Mathematics 5 or as found in the online
Wolfram Language Reference. As a result, long lists in previous topics
are a bit shorter and there are now more sections. This work was
started in 2.2.0.

More work is needed on formatting and showing this information, with
the additional breakout we now have subsections. More reorganization
and sectioning is needed.

These cleanups will happen in a future version.

Chapters without introductory text like ``Structural Operations``, or ``Tensors`` have had descriptions added.

Sections that were empty have either been expanded or removed because
the underlying name was never a user-level built in, e.g. the various
internal Boxing functions like ``DiskBox``, or ``CompiledCodeBox``

Documentation specific builtins like ``PolarPlot`` or
``BernsteinBasis`` have been added improved, and document examples
have been revised such as for ``PieChart``, ``Pi`` and others.

The Mathics Gallery examples have been updated.

Some slight improvements were made to producing the PDF and more kinds
of non-ASCII symbols are tolerated. Expect more work on this in the
future via tables from the `Mathics Scanner <https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Scanner/1.2.1/>`_ project.

Chapters are no longer in Roman Numerals.


Internal changes
++++++++++++++++

* ``docpipline.py``  accepts the option ``--chapters`` or ``-c`` to narrow tests to a particular chapter
* Format routines have been isolated into its own module. Currently we have format routines for SVG, JSON and
  Asymptote. Expect more reorganization in the future.
* Boxing routines have been isolated to its own module.
* The entire code base has been run through the Python formatter `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
* More Python3 types to function signatures have been added.
* More document tests that were not user-visible have been moved to
  unit tests which run faster. More work is needed here.

2.2.0
-----

Package update
++++++++++++++

Internal changes
----------------

* ``docpipeline.py``  accepts the option ``-d`` to show how long it takes to parse, evaluate and compare each individual test.
  ``-x`` option (akin to ``pytests -x`` is a short-hand for stop on first error
* Some builtin functions have been grouped together in a module
  underneath the top-level builtin directory.  As a result, in the
  documents you will list some builtins listed under an overarching
  categery like ``Specific Functions`` or ``Graphics, Drawing, and
  Images``. More work is expected in the future to improve document sectioning.
* ``System`$Notebooks`` is removed from settings. It is in all of the front-ends now.

Pymathics Modules
+++++++++++++++++

* Pymathics modules now can run initialization code when are loaded.
* The ``builtins`` list is not hard-linked to the library anymore. This simplifies
  the loading and reloading of pymathics modules.
* Decoupling of BoxConstructors from the library. Now are defined at the
  level of the definition objects. This is useful for customizing the
  Graphics output if it is available.


Miscellanea
+++++++++++

* A pass was made to improve Microsoft Windows compatibility and testing Windows under MSYS.
* Include numpy version in version string. Show in CLI
* Small CLI tweaks ``--colors=None`` added to match mathicsscript.
* In the ``BaseExpression`` and derived classes, the method ``boxes_to_xml`` now are called ``boxes_to_mathml``.

* ``Series[]`` See `Issue #1193 <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/issues/1194>`_.


2.0.0
-----

To accommodate growth and increased use of pieces of Mathics inside other packages, parts of Mathics have been split off and moved to separate packages. In particular:

* The Django front-end is now a PyPI installable package called `Mathics-Django <https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Django/>`_.
* Scanner routines, character translation tables to/from Unicode, and character properties are now `mathics-scanner https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-scanner`_.
* Specific builtins involving heavy, non-standard routines were moved to pymathics modules `pymathics-graph https://github.com/Mathics3/pymathics-graph`_, `pymathics-natlang https://github.com/Mathics3/pymathics-natlang`_.

Incompatible changes:
+++++++++++++++++++++

* ``-e`` ``--execute`` is better suited for embedded use. It shows just evaluation output as text.
* Docker scripts ``dmathics``, ``dmathicsscript`` and ``dmathicsserver`` have been removed. They are part of the ``docker-mathics`` a separate PyPI package.

The bump in the major version number reflects major changes in this release. Another major release is planned soon, with more major changes.

See below for future work planned.

New builtins
++++++++++++

- ``AnglePath``,  ``AnglePathFold``, ``AngleVector``
- ``BoxData``, ``TextData``, ``InterpretationBox``, ``StyleBox``, ``TagBox``, ``TemplateBox``, ``ButtonBox``, ``InterpretationBox``

+++++++++++++

Mathematical Constants is now its own module/section. Constants have been filled out. These constants have been added:

- ``Catalan``
- ``Degree``
- ``Glaisher``
- ``GoldenRatio``
- ``Khinchin``

Many of these and the existing constants are computable via mpmath, NumPy, or Sympy.

Settings through WL variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Certain aspects of the kernel configuration are now controlled by variables, defined in ``/autoad/settings.m``.

- ``$GetTrace`` (``False`` by default).  Defines if when a WL module is load through ``Get``, definitions will be traced (for debug).
- ``$PreferredBackendMethod`` Set this do whether to use mpmath, NumPy or SymPy for numeric and symbolic constants and methods when there is a choice (``"sympy"`` by default) (see #1124)

Enhancements
++++++++++++

- Add ``Method`` option "mpmath" to compute ``Eigenvalues`` using mpmath (#1115).
- Improve support for ``OptionValue`` and ``OptionsPattern`` (#1113)

Bug fixes
+++++++++

Numerous bugs were fixed while working on Combinatorica V0.9 and CellsToTeX.

- ``Sum``'s lower and upper bounds can now be Mathics expressions

Miscellanea
+++++++++++

- Enlarge the set of ``gries_schneider`` tests
- Improve the way builtins modules are loaded at initialization time (#1138).

Future
++++++

* We are in the process of splitting out graphics renderers, notably for matplotlib. See `pymathics-matplotlib <https://github.com/Mathics3/pymathics-matplotlib>`_.
* Work is also being done on asymptote. See `PR #1145 <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/pull/1145>`_.
* Makeboxes is being decoupled from a renderer. See `PR #1140 <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/pull/1140>`_.
* Inline SVG will be supported (right now SVG is binary).
* Better support integrating Unicode in output (such as for Rule arrows) is in the works. These properties will be in the scanner package.
* A method option ("mpmath", "sympy", or "numpy") will be added to the ``N[]``. See `PR #1144 <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/pull/1144>`_.


1.1.1
-----

This may be the last update before some major refactoring and interface changing occurs.

In a future 2.0.0 release, Django will no longer be bundled here. See `mathics-django <https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-django>` for the unbundled replacement.

Some changes were made to support `Pymathics Graph <https://github.com/Mathics3/pymathics-graph>`_, a new graph package bundled separately, and to support the ability for front-ends to handle rendering on their own. Note that currently this doesn't integrate well into the Django interface, although it works well in ``mathicsscript``.

Package updates
+++++++++++++++

- SymPy 1.7.1

Mathics Packages added:

- ``DiscreteMath`CombinatoricaV0.9`` (preferred) and
  ``DiscreteMath`CombinatoricaV0.6``.

Both of these correspond to Steven Skiena's *older* book: *Implementing Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics and Graph Theory*.

If you have a package that you would like included in the distribution, and it works with Mathics, please contact us.

Rubi may appear in a future release, possibly in a year or so. Any help to make this happen sooner is appreciated.

New builtins
++++++++++++

- ``StirlingS1``, ``StirlingS2`` (not all WL variations handled)
- ``MapAt`` (not all WL variations handled)
- ``PythonForm``, ``SympyForm``: not in WL.
  Will show a crude translation to SymPy or Python.
  Expect more and better translation later

Backward incompatibilities
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Support for Python 3.5 and earlier, and in particular Python 2.7,
  was dropped.
- The ``graphs`` module (for Graphs) has been pulled until Mathics
  supports pymathics and graphics using networkx better. It will
  reappear as a pymathics module.
- The ``natlang`` (for Natural Language processing) has also been
  pulled.  The problem here too is that the pymathics mechanism needs
  a small amount of work to make it scalable, and in 1.0 these were
  hard coded. Also, both this module and ``graphs`` pulled in some
  potentially hard-to-satisfy non-Python dependencies such as
  matplotlib, or NLP libraries, and word lists. All of this made
  installation of Mathics harder, and the import of these libraries,
  ``natlang`` in particular, took some time. All of this points to having
  these live in their own repositories and get imported on lazily on
  demand.
