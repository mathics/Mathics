Note:

* Integration rules of Rubi are still under active development.
* The code here of Rubi is woefully subsetted and provided to enable the Mathics community for testing and debugging to be able to fully support Rubi.
* The code here should not be widely distributed until Mathics fully supports Rubi and is able to successfully pass Rubi's entire test-suite.
* When and if that time comes, coordinate with Albert Rich to ensure we have Rubi's latest rules and test-suite.

Run `Needs["RubyCLI`"]` to load this package.
