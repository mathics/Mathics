    Please see

    https://github.com/rebcabin/Mathics/blob/master/mathics/packages/

    for the most up-to-date version. Changes will be committed there from now
    on.

    When mathics itself is updated, you must reinstall it:

        python setup.py install

    You can run unit tests as follows:

        python setup.py test

    This is an extended transcription of Gries & Schnedier, "A Logical Approach
    to Discrete Math," into mathics (https://goo.gl/wSm1wt), a free clone of
    Mathematica (https://goo.gl/0uvLZ), written in Python. I got mathics to run
    on Python 3.5 and not on Python 3.6.

    @Book{gries1993a,
     author = {Gries, David},
     title = {A Logical Approach to Discrete Math},
     publisher = {Springer New York},
     year = {1993},
     address = {New York, NY},
     isbn = {978-1-4757-3837-7}}

    Why are we doing this? Gries & Schnedier is a great example of a formal
    method. Formal methods means "machine-checked proofs." Formal Methods help
    you write better software. They can help you avoid billion-dollar mistakes,
    like crashing the Mars Climate Observer because the units of measure
    "newton" and "pound-force" were not checked by machine. Like losing customer
    data in a cloud database because of an unanticipated edge-case thirty-five
    steps into a leader-election protocol.

    Fall in love with formal methods, please! They're related to static
    type-checking (that's a little formal method in your compiler, proving
    little theorems about types in your code), and great things like
    Clojure.spec (https://goo.gl/sttnFC). I think a lot of people know those are
    good, but there are lots of other, lesser-known formal methods like
    Statecharts (https://statecharts.github.io/) and TLA+
    (https://goo.gl/dx32Mw). Statecharts allowed me to formally prove that an
    embedded controller for a robot had no bugs. TLA+ saved Amazon's Dynamo DB a
    catastrophic failure (https://goo.gl/pTpZYT). Many mistakes have been found
    in published algorithms and protocols at the foundational layer of the
    internet and cloud computing when those protocols were subjected to formal
    methods (no citation).
