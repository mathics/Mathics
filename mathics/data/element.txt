Notes:
Mathematica appears to use an Algorithmic approach to classifying elements by Series. This gives discrepancy with Mathics
    Elements 71 and 103 are described as Lanthanides and Actinides by Wikipedia based on their chemical and physical properties. 
    Super heavy elements 109, 110, 111, 113+ incorrectly classified by Mathematica.
